"write a poem": `Ok! Here is a poem about a person dreaming:  
A road unwinds beneath the stars,  
A path that whispers, near and far.  
Each step a dream, each breath a prayer,  
The journey calls, with skies so fair...  
Through mountains tall, through valleys deep,  
The dreamer's heart will never sleep.  
For in the night, a light will shine,  
Guiding the soul, through space and time.`,
